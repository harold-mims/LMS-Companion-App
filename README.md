# LMS_Companion_App

A Flutter Application built for the LMS capstone team

## How this app functions

This project is built as a companion app for the LMS- Wheelchair bedsore prevention capstone project.

The primary purpose of this app is to connect to provide the end user an easy and simple interface for controlling the hardware through a bluetooth connection. Currently the only signal needed is a target signal for the motor roller, providing a percentage of full power to be interpreted by the emdedded device.

As this project is desiged as a proof of concept and a research platform for further development in the future, it is important that the methods used for transmiting data are adaptable so that it can be adapted to transmit pressure data without needing to be reworked.
